# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

This is Todo app which takes two inputs as title and description and by pressing 'add todo' button the new todo gets add.

Then there is a select option which lets you filter the completed and incompleted todo, there is one input box as well which let you filter the todo whatever you type in the box if that has in any todo's title or description it will show you that

Then there are stats about your all todos like total todos, completed, incompleted and percentage

and at the end you get all your todos list.

I have used recoil in this project and tried to make it as organised as possible .

please feel free to add more functionality or styling i'll be more than happy to merge your valid pull request.
